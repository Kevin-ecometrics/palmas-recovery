				<h1 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Recovery House vs. Hotel: 3 Reasons Why Your Healing Depends on Professional Care</h1>
				
				<p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">After a life-changing plastic surgery procedure, your environment matters just as much as your surgeon's skill. While many patients assume a luxury hotel is the best place to recover, the reality is that <span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">true recovery requires medical expertise and supervision</span>.<br/><br/>Your recovery space should promote rest, eliminate stress, and provide the right mix of comfort and functionality. Choosing a recovery house means choosing peace of mind. Here is why your post-operative journey deserves more than just a room with a view.</p>

				<h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#8a9a6a] mt-10 mb-4">The Critical First Days: What to Expect</h3>
				<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">The initial 48 to 72 hours after surgery are known as the <span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">acute healing phase</span>. During this time, you will experience peak swelling, bruising, and fatigue. This exhaustion is a signal that your body is redirecting all its energy toward cellular repair.</p>

				<h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#8a9a6a] mb-4">Essentials of Post-Op Care:</h4>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700">
					<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Expert Monitoring:</span> Checking incisions daily for signs of infection or separation.</li>
					<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Wound Support:</span> Knowing how to "brace" your incisions when coughing, sitting, or using the bathroom.</li>
					<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Proper Hygiene:</span> Cleaning dressings and incisions exactly as directed by clinical protocols.</li>
					<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Symptom Management:</span> Distinguishing between normal post-op discomfort and a potential complication.</li>
				</ul>

				<p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">While hotels offer "luxury," they are not equipped to handle medical emergencies. At <span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Palmas Recovery House</span>, we bridge the gap between the operating room and your home, ensuring that your results are protected during these vulnerable first days.</p>

				<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#70805a] mt-12 mb-6 text-center">Only trust professionals when it comes to your health.</h2>

				<h1 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-16 mb-6">3 Reasons Why Professional Care is Vital for Your Results</h1>

							<div>
								<h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#8a9a6a] mb-3">1. Medical Oversight vs. "On-Your-Own" Care</h3>
								<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">At a hotel, you are essentially on your own or relying on a well-meaning friend or family member. This can quickly become overwhelming when managing surgical drains, complex medication schedules, and limited mobility.</p>
								<p className="text-gray-700"><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">The Palmas Difference:</span> You are never alone. Our patients are cared for by experienced nurses and on-site doctors who monitor vital signs, track fluid output, and manage pain. Having doctors in-house means we can identify and address early signs of complications before they become serious issues.</p>

								<h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#8a9a6a] mb-3">2. Designed for Patients, Not Tourists</h3>
								<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Hotels are designed for short-term travelers. They offer soft beds and room service, but they lack the functionality required for surgery:</p>
								<ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
									<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Adjustable Beds:</span> Necessary for maintaining the specific angles required to reduce swelling and tension on incisions.</li>
									<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Safety Features:</span> Nursing call systems and bathrooms designed for patients with limited mobility.</li>
									<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Nutritional Support:</span> While hotels offer heavy "vacation food," our recovery suites provide meals specifically prepared to support healing and reduce inflammation.</li>
								</ul>

							<div>
								<h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#8a9a6a] mb-3">3. Access to Clinical Healing Therapies</h3>
								<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">One of the most significant advantages of a professional recovery house is the access to specialized therapies that accelerate healing. At Palmas Recovery, we provide:</p>
								<ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
									<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Manual Lymphatic Drainage:</span> Specialized massages to reduce swelling and improve circulation.</li>
									<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Professional Garment Management:</span> Assistance with the difficult task of changing and adjusting compression garments.</li>
									<li><span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Direct Surgeon Communication:</span> We collaborate closely with Tijuana's top double board-certified surgeons to ensure their specific post-op instructions are followed to the letter.</li>
								</ul>

				<h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#8a9a6a] mt-12 mb-4">Your Results are an Investment — Protect Them</h3>
				<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">Most patients return to work within 7 to 14 days, but the foundation for that "final look" is laid in the first week. Recovering in an inexperienced setting can lead to additional costs, prolonged healing times, and compromised aesthetic results.</p>

				<h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#8a9a6a] mb-4">Before you book your recovery stay, ask these essential questions:</h4>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700">
					<li>Are there medical doctors or licensed nurses on-site 24/7?</li>
					<li>How many years has the facility been operating under professional medical protocols?</li>
					<li>Is pricing all-inclusive (meals, nursing care, and specialized therapies)?</li>
				</ul>

				<p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">At <span className="font-semibold text-[#70805a]">Palmas Recovery House</span>, we believe your recovery space is part of your treatment. Don't leave your health to chance. Your recovery space is part of your treatment. It's not just about where you'll sleep.</p>
