          Timing Your Transformation: Why the Season Matters for Plastic Surgery in Tijuana
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Tijuana has earned its reputation as the global capital of medical tourism and cosmetic surgery. Situated at the world’s busiest border, it offers world-class medical expertise combined with a vibrant culture. However, when planning your journey, there is one factor many patients overlook: the weather.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Choosing the right season for your procedure isn’t just about travel convenience, it’s about optimizing your biology for healing.

        {/* Why Autumn is the "Golden Season" for Surgery */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-[#657251] mb-4">
          Why Autumn is the "Golden Season" for Surgery
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Specialists often cite Autumn as the ideal time for cosmetic procedures in Mexico. Here is why:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. Reduced Swelling and Irritation</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Moderate temperatures prevent the excessive sweating that can irritate fresh incisions, bandages, and surgical wounds. Cool air is a natural ally in keeping inflammation down.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Lower UV Radiation</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Solar radiation is the enemy of a healing scar. Lower UV levels in the fall and winter significantly reduce the risk of skin discoloration or permanent hyperpigmentation around incision sites.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Comfort in Compression</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Many procedures, such as Liposuction, Tummy Tucks, or Liposculpture, require the use of tight compression garments (fajas) for several weeks. These are much more comfortable to wear when it isn't 90°F (32°C) outside.
        </p>

        {/* Seasonal Benefits by Procedure */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-[#657251] mb-4">
          Seasonal Benefits by Procedure
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Breast Surgeries (Augmentation or Reduction)</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          These procedures benefit greatly from the cooler months. A cool climate makes wearing the necessary postoperative surgical bra much more bearable and reduces the discomfort associated with heat-induced swelling.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Body Remodeling</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          For surgeries requiring extensive bandages, the fall and winter months promote better consistency in wearing your garments, which is crucial for achieving your final aesthetic goals.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Facial Rejuvenation (Rhinoplasty, Facelift, Blepharoplasty)</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Facial skin is incredibly sensitive after surgery. Choosing a season with low UV radiation protects your face from blemishes and allows you to recover more discreetly.
        </p>
